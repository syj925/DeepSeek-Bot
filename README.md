# DeepSeek Bot

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.1_preview-blue) ![DSH](https://img.shields.io/badge/DSH-0.2.0--rc.2-4D6BFE) ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_2.0-green)

DeepSeek Bot (DS Bot) is a bot plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH). It turns DSH into bots. You create your own bots, then talk and work with them.

![Say one sentence to Chief, and it sets up the bots and the group chat](docs/images/team.png)

## Install

First install DSH and set up at least one model in it. DS Bot uses the models from DSH.

**DSH Desktop (Windows, macOS)**

1. In the sidebar, select **Plugins** → **Add plugin**.
2. In **Package name or address**, enter `ds-bot`. In mainland China, set **Registry** to **Mainland China mirror**.
3. Select **Install**, then **Enable now**. If DSH says the change takes effect at the next start, quit DSH completely and open it again.

If npm is not reachable, in step 2 you can also enter the full path of `ds-bot-0.1.5.tgz` downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot/releases), or `github:Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot#v0.1.5&path:/ds-bot` (needs Git).

**DSH Web (Windows, macOS, Linux)**

Needs Node.js `22.19` or later, and pnpm.

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2 plugin --profile web add ds-bot
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2 web
```

## Setup

I strongly recommend that you set up your other bots and group chats by just talking to a bot.

## Features

### Employee canvas (unreleased)

This development branch adds a canvas for persistent employees and group chats. The background fills the workspace, with dark translucent glass panels, a movable, collapsible team list and a centered avatar dock. This glass theme is local to the canvas. Use **Create employee** to configure a new Bot, or open an existing one from **Employee directory**, the team list or the dock. Expanded conversations can move and resize; compacting or closing them preserves the employee, memory and conversation.

Employees start as draggable 120×112 avatar entries; Rooms remain 320×200 summaries with their real members. Click an employee avatar or a Room's **Open conversation** to load its conversation. Several manually opened conversations can stay visible together. Reloading restores compact entries and positions without loading all histories. **Arrange cards** packs entries by their actual sizes and visual groups; **Collapse conversations** keeps their positions. Moving and grouping entries never loads a conversation or stops background work.

**Quick message** and **Agenda** are separate movable, collapsible panels. Quick message identifies its employee recipient and sends through the existing messaging action without opening history; each employee has a separate locally saved quick-message draft. Agenda reads the existing scheduled-task catalog and links to its settings, showing empty or unavailable states when appropriate.

The default wallpaper is an original illustration of a misty lake, distant mountains and forest, bundled for offline use. Choose **Wallpaper → Choose local image** in the canvas toolbar to replace it with a picture from your computer. JPEG, PNG, WebP and AVIF files up to 25 MB are supported. The image fills the workspace, stays centered while you pan or zoom, and has a dark overlay to keep the glass panels readable. It is resized and saved only in the current browser or app profile, with no upload or image-generation API call. **Restore default background** removes the saved image and returns to the lake illustration. A failed selection keeps the previous wallpaper.

Drag the background to pan, Shift-drag to select windows, and Ctrl-scroll to zoom. **Group windows** arranges windows together; rename its label to organize the layout. Select employees or use a visual group's **Create group chat** action to preselect members in the original group form, then choose its admin and confirm. Room cards expose their admin, reply mode, member avatars and work, and group settings. Employee avatars retain details and the original management menu; selecting exactly two employees also opens their Bot exchange. There are no manual connection lines or workflow actions. Choose **Classic view** in the toolbar for the original conversation pane and sidebar, and **Employee canvas** in the sidebar to return. Layout, panel positions, quick-message drafts and view preference are saved in this browser, without syncing to other devices.

### Bot

You can do all your talking and work with one bot, in one window. You don't need to worry about the context behind it. The bot's details page shows its info, and there you can pick the model you want it to use. You can switch models at any time, but I still recommend that you keep one model for a bot for a long time, and switch only when you really need to.

Bots also have memory. A bot remembers what you like and uses it in later work. You can manage its memory on the bot's details page, or just tell the bot.

![Bot details: model, memory, usage](docs/images/details.png)

### Main bot

The main bot is your chief. It has very high rights: it manages the other bots and the group chats. The first time you open DS Bot, there is already a main bot called Chief. Talk to it, and it walks you through the setup.

In short: have a question? Ask the main bot.

### Group chats

DS Bot has group chats. A group chat is a great way to get several bots to work together, but it clearly costs more. So DS Bot does this: every group chat has an admin. The admin answers your messages by default and calls in the other bots for you. You can also @ a bot directly, and it answers you directly: type @ and pick the bot from the list. To give the bots another chat as context, use + → Reference a chat in the message box.

Any bot can hand work to another bot with @. That bot does the work on its own, and the group goes on. While it works, the group, the sidebar and the bot's own chat show what it is doing. When it is done, it posts the result in the group, and the bot that asked for the work answers. To stop the work, open the group's details.

![Group chat: the admin, Chief, hands the work to Writer and Coder](docs/images/group.png)

### Capabilities

Settings → **Capabilities** is a shared library of MCP servers, skills and packs. Add a capability to a Bot in its settings; it is available from that Bot's next message in its own chat and group chats. A local MCP command that a Bot adds needs your approval before it can run. While other Bots use a capability, only you or a Main Bot can change or delete it.

### Usage

In **Settings** → **Usage**, you can see token usage by time, by bot and by model.

## Data

Employee, group-chat and conversation data stay on your own computer, in `bot/` and `sessions/` in the DSH home folder (`~/.dsh` by default). Uninstalling the plugin does not delete this data. Canvas layout and the selected wallpaper are separate browser-local data; clearing browser storage resets the layout and removes the wallpaper without deleting employees or conversations.

## Development

The plugin source is in [`ds-bot/`](ds-bot/). For options and internals, see [`ds-bot/README.md`](ds-bot/README.md). For development and tests, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For changes between versions, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
